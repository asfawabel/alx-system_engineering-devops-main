Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours (March 4, 2023, 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST)

Impact: The login service for our web application was down, affecting 30% of our users who were unable to access their accounts.

Root Cause: The outage was caused by a recent update to the authentication module, which contained a bug that prevented user authentication.

Timeline:

8:00 AM - The issue was detected by monitoring alerts, which showed a significant increase in failed login attempts.

8:10 AM - The engineering team was notified of the issue and began investigating.

8:30 AM - The team identified that the authentication module was causing the issue and began investigating potential solutions.

9:00 AM - The team attempted to roll back the recent update but encountered difficulties due to database schema changes.

10:00 AM - Misleading investigation paths were taken, as the team initially suspected an issue with the database.

11:00 AM - The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team for further assistance.

12:00 PM - The incident was resolved by implementing a hotfix to the authentication module.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a bug introduced in a recent update to the authentication module. The bug caused the authentication module to reject all login attempts, preventing users from accessing their accounts.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team implemented a hotfix to the authentication module that addressed the bug. The hotfix was applied without requiring a full rollback of the recent update.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues in the future, the engineering team will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:

Improve testing processes to catch bugs before updates are released to production.
Implement more comprehensive monitoring of authentication module performance.
Establish a protocol for rolling back updates when necessary.
Conduct a postmortem to identify areas for improvement and document lessons learned.
Specific tasks to address the issue include:

Conduct a code review of the authentication module to identify and fix potential bugs.
Improve testing processes to include more comprehensive unit and integration testing.
Implement additional monitoring for failed login attempts and authentication module performance.
Create a rollback plan for future updates.
Schedule a postmortem meeting with the engineering team to identify areas for improvement and implement changes.
In conclusion, the recent outage was caused by a bug in the authentication module and lasted for 4 hours, affecting 30% of our users. The incident was resolved by implementing a hotfix to the authentication module, and corrective and preventative measures will be taken to prevent similar issues in the future.
